# CAFA6-competition
## Project Overview
This repository contains code for the CAFA6 (Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation) competition, which focuses on predicting protein function annotations using Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

## Competition Context
- **Goal**: Predict GO term associations for protein sequences across three ontologies (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component)
- **Data Format**: Protein sequences (FASTA), GO annotations, evaluation based on precision-recall curves
- **Key Challenge**: Multi-label classification with hierarchical ontology structure
